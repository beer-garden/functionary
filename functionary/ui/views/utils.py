    For any session there is always a single active environment. This function
    adds the environment to the session as "environment_id" and the user's permissions
    for that environment, with entries in the form of "user_can_<action>_<model>". For
    example:

        * user_can_create_task
        * user_can_update_workflow

    This makes it possible to do easy checks in a template, for example, by
    ensuring the request is in the context and then doing a simple check such as:

        {% if request.session.user_can_create_task %}

        request: The HttpRequest containing the session to update
        environment: The environment to make active for the session
